# Tally-Light
<h4>
  CASE:
</h4>
<h5>
  I modeled simple case and printed it on my 3D printers and file are in <a href="https://github.com/Dodo765/datavideo/blob/main/case">case folder</a>.
  <br>
  <p>
    In main <a href="https://github.com/Dodo765/datavideo/blob/main/case/tally case v10.3mf">case file</a> there are 3 elements: top, middle and bottom elements.<br>
    Top and bottom should be printed on FDM 3D printer (I printed in PLA) and middle element must be printed in half-transparent material - in my case black resin.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    In case I designed space for external antena (It usually comes with wemos d1 pro mini, witch I used) and space for ARGB LED strip of 9 LEDs (WS2812b 60LEDs/m).
